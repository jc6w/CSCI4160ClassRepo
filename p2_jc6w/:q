       alarm - set an alarm clock for delivery of a signal

       aallaarrmm() arranges for a SSIIGGAALLRRMM signal to be delivered to the calling process in _s_e_c_o_n_d_s seconds.

       If _s_e_c_o_n_d_s is zero, any pending alarm is canceled.

       In any event any previously set aallaarrmm() is canceled.

RREETTUURRNN VVAALLUUEE
       aallaarrmm()  returns  the  number of seconds remaining until any previously scheduled alarm was due to be delivered, or zero if there was no previously
       scheduled alarm.

NNOOTTEESS
       aallaarrmm() and sseettiittiimmeerr(2) share the same timer; calls to one will interfere with use of the other.

       Alarms created by aallaarrmm(()) are preserved across eexxeeccvvee(2) and are not inherited by children created via ffoorrkk(2).

       sslleeeepp(3) may be implemented using SSIIGGAALLRRMM; mixing calls to aallaarrmm() and sslleeeepp(3) is a bad idea.

       Scheduling delays can, as ever, cause the execution of the process to be delayed by an arbitrary amount of time.
